# EulerConstantCalculator-Using-Randomness
This program uses probablity to approximately calculate the value of euler constant.

This program uses creates a sample of `n` numbers. The sample is shuffled `trials` times. The program counts the number of shffules that produce derangements. The probablity of a shuffle producing a derangement is `1/e` as the sample size and number of trials approach infinity.

More information on derangements: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derangement
